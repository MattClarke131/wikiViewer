Shawn's Code Review of wikiViewer
================================================================================
1. The repeated anchor tags are ugly. DO try to use javascript to copy and populate
a template.

2. Reduce the amount of "state" in code.
  2.1. Global variables are bad (functional programming paradigm);
  2.2. Use Function parameters to make pure functions.
  e.g. move searchResults into functions.

3. Escape url parameter searchTerm (& in searchTerm messes with the function)
  3.1. Escape searchResults contents
  3.2. InnerHTML is a good indicator that you need to escape

4. Rename "form" and "formContents" variables.
  4.1. Having well named variables is beneficial

5. Declare character encoding at the top of the head with:
  5.1. <meta charset="utf-8">
